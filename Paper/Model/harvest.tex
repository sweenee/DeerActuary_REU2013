\section{Harvesting And Sensitivity}

An issue that arises in the study by Schwabe \textit{et al} is the
sensitivity of the total rate of harvest with the associated
parameters. Here we examine the expected total rate of harvest at
steady state as a function of the parameters that arise in a logistic
equation with a proportional harvest term. We find that there is a
maximum harvest that occurs in the middle of the possible range of
values for the parameter.
